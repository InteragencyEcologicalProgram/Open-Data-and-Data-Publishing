# IEP-to-EDI-Publishing
The IEP Data Utility Working Group (DUWG) is making large strides towards OpenScience! The DUWG has decided to work with Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) to serve as the home for IEP datasets (see the first two published IEP datasets at https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/simpleSearch). 

EDI is an online data respository and portal that supports data publishing and receiving a Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for citations, version control, and data tracking. Open Science and data publishing is a great tool for synthesis science, and for all the people invovled in collecting field and lab data to get recognition. 
Each data package on EDI is has associated metadata held to high Ecological Metadata (EML) standards, with modifications and additions from the IEP DUWG subcommittees. 
EDI also has quality check reports that must be evaluated before the publication of a data package. 

The attached resources provide instructions for IEP data managers and PIs on how to publish datasets to the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository. 


INSTRUCTIONAL DOCUMENTS:

1.) A blank metadata template  (see also the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Programs example metadata document)

2.) Step-wise instructions for generating a machine readable metadata document (.xml) in EMLassemblyline in R. (You will want to be sure to download R and R-studio).

3.) R code for EMLassemblyline, example from Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (titled "my_workflow_YBFMP").

4.) A powerpoint presentation is provided showing examples of each EMLassemblyline step using the Yolo Bypass Fish data.

5.) Once you're done creating your metadata in EML, use the Staging and Production instructions to publish your IEP dataset.
