#YBFMP EXAMPLE

# (1.)  create a new folder or working directory and put your data files into it. All the EML template files will be added here, ina ddition to the final .xml document.
setwd("C:/Users/bedavis/OneDrive - California Department of Water Resources/My Documents/IEP/EDI/EMLassemblyLine_YBFMP_082018")

# (2.) drop all final files-tables ready to publish in this directory. Be sure naming is is in proper format, e.g. name.of.(your) d@t@.file should be name_of_your_data_file

#You can't have any empty cells in the data tables so what I did was called in the tables and re-wrote them populating the emppty cells with NAs. If there are empty cells you will get an error code. The later you will add a descriptor for "NA" missing values in the files.

#NOW YOU"RE READY TO BEGIN
#Follow steps in the word document and powerpoint I provided and generate your code. EDI on github can be a great additional resource.

# (3.) select INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS, IEP decided on "CCBY"
# (4.) identify types of data

# (5.) import core metadata templates

# View documentation for this function
?import_templates

#Import EML templates, enter working directory path, license and the data file names.

# data tables must be .csv files, xlx file types wil be coerced and no attribute files will be created

# After running the below line additional instructions will be provided in the wording directory
?view_instructions  # Opens documentation for this function, including detailed instructions for templates
view_instructions() # Prints instructions to the RStudio console window

# (6.) SCRIPT WORKFLOW to create a metadata template for te future. You'll see "my_workflow.R" was generatedd in the working directory but at this time you propable already started you're own R-code, re-save this file in the directory.

# (7.) ABSTRACT > copy/paste abstract from word document to template abstract.txt. Use https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi/diacriticsremover/ to remove any non-unicode characters (sybmols, formatting, hyperlinks). Click remove Diacritics at the website.

# (8.) METHODS. add all methods into the method.txt file. For YBFMP include all gear type, equipment information, site information, and QA/QC protocols. Once written in the EDI metaddata template, copy/paste into the above website to remove and non-unicode characters.

# (9.) ADDITIONAL INFO, add any additional metadata information, I added a list of publications using the data

# (10.) KEYWORDS, fill out table and text file. Be sure to include "Interagency Ecological Program for the San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary

# (11.) PERSONNEL, fill out table and text file, see comments in intructions and word template

# (12.) ATTRIBUTES, fill all attribute files, copy/paste text from file into an excel file to add all descripters.

#use the standard units from the R dictionary, if not in the dictionary you will need to fill out the custom unit text file. I had to do this for turbidity "microSeimenPerCentimeter"
#View the standard unit dictionary of the Ecological Metadata Language schema in the RStudio source window.
view_unit_dictionary()

# (13.) CLOSE ALL FILES, some function will error out and not product categorical variable files if open.

# (14.) Define categroical variables, reads the attribute files generated in the working directory and creates additional text files for you to define each categorical variable.
define_catvars(path = "C:/Users/bedavis/OneDrive - California Department of Water Resources/My Documents/IEP/EDI/EMLassemblyLine_YBFMP_082018")

#re-run until all error codes and warnings are removed, for example all trailing characters such a SpCnd of 312 versus 311.99000. reduce to single decimals. The consul results should be clean for the final eml assembly to work correctly.

# (15.) extract locations for all sites with specific coordinate information
?extract_geocoverage

# The Bouding boxes.txt file is only used if you have multiple areas (regions), Yolo has one general area that we will include in the make_eml so DELETE the bounding boxes text file from the workplace otherwise you will get a replication error. EDI is going to fix this so we can put site points within the regions. Re-install periodically to check if that has occurred or leave as only geocoverage defining all specific sites.

#The output in the consule will tell you if you passed or failed the EML validation. If you failed you need to fix errors until valid.
